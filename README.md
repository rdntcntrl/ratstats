# Ratstats

Web-based game statistics for Ratarena.

## Installing

Install `npm`.

Install Tailwind:

    npm install -D tailwindcss


After installing Tailwind, run

    make clean
    make dist

The production-ready files will then be put in the `dist/` directory. Note that
this will **NOT** contain any demo match statistics in `matches/`, nor an
`matches.json` (which lists those matches).

If you wish to deploy this, those files need to be generated first (or copy the
demo stats from `demo_stats/` into dist/).

### Dev Server

To run a development server with demo stats that automatically updates the CSS
when anything is changed, run

    make demo
    ./devserve.sh

The server listens on 127.0.0.1:8000

You can replace the stats shown by replacing `www/matches.json` and `www/matches`.
(These will be deleted by `make clean`)

### Backend

Use the `statsprocess.py` to watch the game stats exports and convert them into the format expected by this webpage. It will also generate the match index JSON.

## Levelshots

After `make dist`, put the map levelshots in `dist/images/lvlshot` (as jpg).

For the development server (after `make demo`), put them in `www/images/lvlshot` instead.
